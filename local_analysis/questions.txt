Questions

Biggest question:
In Ohio:
- Are people more likely to vote in local elections in general elections years?
	Initially, compare across the same year (2018)
	Can expand to multiple years if I want to do timeseries stuff
- If so, by how much?
- What kind of local elections? - can break down by office type
	need to be careful about multiple candidate voting potentially
- To what extent does it vary by county?

Question(s) to start with: 
For Lorain County, OH
- How many people voted?
- How many eligible voters are in the county?
- What was on the ballot?
- What other issues were there on ballot?
- Of the people who voted, how often did people vote non-National Senate/House reps?

Basic summary statistics:
- How many ballots were cast, total
- # votes cast for a national candidate / total votes
- # votes cast for each office / total votes

Compare to a similar county in another state and see if any differences. 


Are people more likely to vote the entire ballot in non-presidential election years?


Larger questions:
- How many people vote when the national-level offices are not on the ballot?
    Is there a different between Senate and House on non-presidential election years?

Types of questions I could ask based on the data:
- How many people vote when the national-level offices are not on the ballot?
- What about Senate vs House vs only local elections?
- Need a different dataset in combination: What kinds of people vote in which elections? Demographic differences?
- How does it vary across state, counties within states, similar-sized counties in different states?
- What are possible factors (ideally based on pre-existing research) that could explain these differences?
- Do people just ignore downballot issues? How many people of the people voting actually vote for the local initiatives?


Motivation:
Results of local elections and initiatives tend to make more a difference on a day-to-day basis for most people than national elections. Yet they are less flashy and tend to get less turnout than national elections. How does this vary by state, county, etc?
